Annual letter with the most mentions of "climate change"
```

prompt:

What was done for climate change?
```

answer:

```
In the Annual Letter 2010 by Bill Gates, several innovations were mentioned to address various global challenges. In the context of climate change, the focus was on the need for a scalable innovation that can produce electricity cheaper than coal and emit no greenhouse gases. Bill Gates mentioned that governments should invest in research and development for such innovations. While the Gates Foundation was not directly involved in this area at the time, Bill Gates himself was investing in ideas outside the foundation to address climate change. He expressed optimism that a scalable innovation in the energy sector would emerge in the next 20 years.
